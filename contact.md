Jekyll is a great tool to create static sites but with static site, but thereâ€™s no backend to send your data to.

Here listed some resources which provide a saas service as a backend for forms (contact forms, hiring forms, etc.) to designers and developers like you:

1. [Formspree (also open source, free)](https://formspree.io/)
2. [FormKeep](https://formkeep.com/guides/contact-form-jekyll)
3. [Simple Form](https://getsimpleform.com/)

### Example Formspree contact form with validation and reCaptcha

Fill in the form or [email me](mailto:{{site.email}}) to discuss your next project.

{% include form.html %}
